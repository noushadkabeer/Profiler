</p>
<p> The Mariposa Land Port of Entry is one of the busiest land ports in the United States. It serves as the main port of 
</p>
<p>entry for fresh produce entering the United States from Mexico and the primary produce distribution point on the 
</p>
<p>southern border,  
</p>
<p>  
Total Cost of Construction: $213 million 
</p>
<p> The project consists of the demolition and new construction of all facilities within the land port of entry. This 
</p>
<p>includes primary and secondary inspection areas for both commercial and non-commercial vehicles, a new 
administration building, a pedestrian-processing facility, a new canine kennel, and other support structures. In 
</p>
<p>addition, new southbound export processing docks and inspection areas will be sized to allow for future export 
</p>
<p>inspection protocols when these programs become effective. Approximately 13 acres adjacent to the port were 
</p>
<p>acquired to accommodate the expansion.
